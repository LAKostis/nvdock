20210623 :: Repository v1.03 :: LAKostis <lakostis@unsafe.ru>
        % Use NVCtrlLib for temperature and version reading. Use code from
	  xfce4-sensors. At least we have a recommended way to read values directly
	  from X11.
	% Supports Multiple GPUs.
	& Fix compilation with recent GCC (-fno-common).
	& Rewrite Makefile to make it distribution-friendly.
	! Fix vars usage and segfaults.
	- Remove unsafe system calls and external utils requirements. We can't
	  rely on grep/sed for version and temperature as output is subject to
	  change.
	& Bring project back :)

20071204 :: Repository v1.02 :: Bob Majdak Jr <bob@kateos.org>
	! Shouldn't zombie a shell anymore.

20071019 :: Repository v1.02 :: Bob Majdak Jr <bob@kateos.org>
	+ Added the NVIDIA driver version to the menu.
	! Fixed a problem with the command line option --parent reporting as
	  unrecognized.

20070901 :: Repository v1.01 Still :: Bob Majdak Jr <bob@kateos.org>
	+ Added auto loading of the NVIDIA settings on launch, and the --no-load
	  option to stop that. Most people probably want it or will never notice
	  it.

20070824 :: Repository v1.01 :: Bob Majdak Jr <bob@kateos.org>
	! Fixed a Segmentation Fault when using the menu more than once if the
	  video card did not have temperature reporting.
	+ Launcher for NVClock (GTK) if it exists on the system.
	+ Menu items with icons.
	+ Command line option --parent, prevents from forking self into a
	  background process automatically.
	+ Command line option --simple-menu, disables menu item icons to run
	  with a slightly less memory use.

20070817 :: Initial Release v1.0 :: Bob Majdak Jr <bob@kateos.org>
	+ Everything.
