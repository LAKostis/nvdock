A tray icon to easily launch the nvidia-settings control panel. Now with
temperature reading! Actually it always had temperature reading, nvidia-settings
does that for me. Also states NVIDIA driver version on the menu.

This was built on Linux, mostly for Linux. It might need some work to work right
on alternte OS like FreeBSD and Solaris. Any feedback is appreciated.

Instructions:

	I applogize but every attempt of mine at setting up autoconf, automake, and
	autoheader fails so I hand wrote the Makefile.

	extract (which you probably already did if you are reading this)
	make
	make install (as root)
